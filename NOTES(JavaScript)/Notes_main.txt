 Javascript --> Scripting Language,
                Dynamic
                Validate at the frontend
                runs on client side (Browser)
        
        Javascript is case sensitive.

Advantages of Javascript:
-------------------------

    1.Less server interaction.
    
    2.Better perfomance.

    3.Rich in Interface.

    4.more interactive


Compiler Characteristics:
-------------------------

    -> Spends lot of time analysing and processing
       the program.
    -> the resulting executable is some form of 
       machine-specific binary code.
    -> the computer hardware interprets(executes)
       the resulting code.
    -> Program execution is fast.

interpreter Characteristics:
----------------------------

    -> relatively little time is spent analysing and 
        processing the program
    -> the resulting code is some sort of intermediate
        code
    -> the resulting code is interpreted by another 
        program
    -> program execution is relatively slow


Javascript Engine:
==================

    Chrome             --> V8
    firefox,NetScape   --> SpiderMonkey
    Mozilla            --> Rhino
    IE/Edge            --> Chakra
    safari             --> JSCore
    Opera              --> V8  -> carakan



    V8  -- GOOGLE's

    -> Multi Threaded program written in c++
    -> Converts to binary code
    -> 

    Fullcodegen --> It consumes entire JS code and 
                    compiles just before Execution.
                    Just-In-Time compiler

                     a simple and very fast compiler 
                     that produced simple and relatively
                     slow machine code.

    crankshaft  --> monitors the code being compiled
                    for hot segment

                    a more complex (Just-In-Time) optimizing 
                    compiler that produced highly-optimized code.

    (hot segment is the code which gets more hits
        E.g for loop)

    main thread     --> fetch--> compiles--> execute
    compiler thread --> fullcodegen && crankshaft
    profiler thread --> it monitors the code
    GC thread       --> Garbage collector

    ways to add Javascript:
    ------------------------

     There are three ways

        1.Inline
        2.Internal/Embedded
        3.External


bag         --> books
container       content

|||y

variable    --> data
container      content

var identifier/var_name;

var is the keyword (see also let .., const)

var_name = value;

DataType --> It defines the type of data

1. Identifier must begin with a-z (or) A-Z (or) _ (or) $
2. it can contain numbers(Alpha Numeric)
3. it is case sensitive.
    (i.e  x is different from X)

 some valid var_names:
    _name12
    $abc
    num123

 some invalid var_names:
    123ac
    %2as
    num!s

DataTypes in Javascript:
========================

 There are 2 main DataTypes
    
    1.primitive
        
        * number
        * string
        * null
        * boolean
        * undefined

    2.Reference/Non primitive

        * Array
        * Object
        * Date
        * Math
        * Functions

    var Identifier = value;

    ; is not mandatory --> ask why?

    String is given inside:

        "" , '' , ``

        ``(Bad ticks)

        E.g

        var name = 'abc';
        var name = "abc";
        var name = `abc`;

    Null can be initialised using null keyword.

        E.g var name = null;

    boolean value is given using true and false. 

        E.g var value = true;

    undefined ---> no definition only declaration.

        var name;

Array
======

    1. Array is a collection of data
    2. it can be homogeneous / heterogeneous in js.

    Array can be declared by in two ways:

        1. by using []
        --------------
        syntax:
            var array_name = [values seperated by ,]
        E.g
         var array_name = [1,2,3,4,5];

        2. by using new keyword
        ------------------------
        syntax:
            var array_name = new Array(values);
        E.g 
         var array_name = new Array(10,20,30);

Object
=======

    Object is an entity which has 
        * states
        * behaviors

    E.g

        Book 

            states   - no_of_pages,Weight,title
            behavior - show(),throw()

    syntax:
    ======

     var obj_name = {
        
        key:value,
        key1:value1,

     }


    var student = {
        id:1,
        name:'abc',
        city:'BLR'
    }

    
xxxxxxx   IMPORTANT POINTS  xxxxxxx


    we can have array inside array.
    (see Multi Dimensional array)

    we can have array inside object.

    we can have object inside array.

Why array index starts with 0 not 1?

    a[n] be an array

    n should not be treated as an index, 
    but as an offset from the array's head.


    statement
    ----------
      
      A statement is an instruction/line of code
      that yields some result.

      operands 
      ========

        there are 2 types of operands

            1.variables
            2.literals

      operators
      =========

            it has some specific functionality

            1. Arithmetic   
            2. Comparision/relational
            3. logical
            4. ternary
            5. typeof

        uses of the console
        ===================

        1.logging purpose
        2.can check the errors
        3.run the js code



Arithmetic operators:
=====================

    + , - , * , / , % , ++ , --

        the usual.

    pre-increment / post-increment (also see)

    pre-increment          
    -------------
    1. the value gets     
       incremented
    2. substitute the 
       value
    3. operation 

    post-increment
    --------------
    1. substitute the 
       value
    2. operation
    3. increment

Comparision/relational
======================

    ==
    !=
    >
    <
    >=
    <=
    ===
    !==

    === and !== are strictly equals and strictly not equals
    it also checks for the DataType along with data

logical
=======

    and  
    or
    not

ternary
=======

    condition ? trueStatement : falseStatement


    greatest of 3 numbers using ternary operators

        (a>b)?((a>c)?a:c):((b>c)?b:c);

typeof
======

    it returns the typeof data

    number --> number
    String --> String
    boolean --> boolean
    Null   ---> Object  #### NOTE
    undefined --> undefined

    Array --> Object
    Object --> Object

    to check if array is array (to return boolean)
    use isArray(array_name) method from Array class

        Array.isArray(myArray);

The template literal
====================

    to include a variable inside string

    ${var_name}

    can be used with `` (only)

    var a=10;
    console.log(`HEllo ${a}`)
